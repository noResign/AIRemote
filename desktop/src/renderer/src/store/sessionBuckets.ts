 * Left-rail buckets. Desktop's value is "see who is waiting on me without
 * switching sessions", which a pure `lastActiveAt` sort destroys — a long run
 * finished minutes ago would cover the session that is blocked on an approval.
 * Order is fixed; only the order *within* a bucket is by recency.
 *
 * Only the two **actionable** states get a bucket of their own. Running used to
 * have one as well and it earned nothing: a running row already carries its own
 * marker (pulse dot + left bar), so promoting it added no information — it just
 * split "sessions that want nothing from me" into two lists.
